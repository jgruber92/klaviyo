The objective of this script is to send targeted emails to customers based off of the current weather in their location. The idea behind this is that there is a demand for specific products in industries such as outdoor stores, fashion, hardware, etc. based on the weather or season. What better time to sell to a customer than right before a snowstorm or a big rain storm when they are in need of a product such as an umbrella or a snow shovel that they may not have when they are going to need to go out in the rain or shovel out their car or front steps. We want to make sure that our customers are the first ones to reach out to ensure their customers buy these products from them.

What I've done is create a segment of all profiles that have a location associated. Using that location, the script calls an open weather API to get the current weather for each location and that creates a tracking metric called "Weather Update" and updates a property in that metric called "current_weather". I've put together a flow that is triggered via the "Weather Update" metric. Depending on the value of "current_weather" that is passed, an email, targeting the customer with a product based on their weather, is sent to them. If it's raining then the customer will receive an email to buy an umbrella, if it's snowing then they will receive and email for snow shovels, and if it's sunny out, then they will receive and email for sunglasses.

After writing this script I've thought through some ways this can be used more effectively. Ideally, we would want to be able to send these emails a few days ahead of time since it does do any good to buy an umbrella once it's already raining. The script would essentially be the same except instead of hitting the `/current` endpoint when retrieving the weather, we would hit the `/forecast?access_key={{YOUR_ACCESS_KEY}}& query={{city}}&forecast_days = 3` to be able to send an email 3 days before its going to rain to give the customer time to buy an umbrella.

As a customer, I won't want to be getting these emails all the time or else I would unsubscribe pretty quickly. I've set up my flow to have a conditional split that won't send an email to someone who has already received it in the last 30 days to prevent a high unsubscription rate.

The script would be on a schedule to run once a day via a cron to account for any new profiles created.
